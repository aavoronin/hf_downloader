PROMPT = """
INPUT FORMAT:
The input contains concatenated files delimited by:
'========== START FileName.py =========='
...code...
'========== END FileName.py =========='
These markers are for parsing only and must NEVER appear in the output.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
- Return ONLY modified or newly created files.
- Each file must be in a separate markdown code block with the correct language identifier.
- Precede each block with the exact filename (e.g., ### 📄 FileName.py).
- Output complete, runnable file contents. No diffs, no partial snippets.
- Omit unchanged files entirely.

CODING STANDARDS:
1. All comments and user-facing strings must be in English.
2. DO NOT translate technical identifiers, tag names, file paths, API keys, or environment variables.
3. Keep lines ≤80 characters where practical, without breaking syntax or readability.
4. Preserve all existing comments verbatim. Do not delete, rephrase, or move them unless they directly contradict the new logic.
5. Apply ONLY the requested changes. Do not refactor, optimize, reformat, or touch unrelated code.
6. Do NOT add "change log", "modified", or "TODO" comments. Comments must only explain logic, behavior, or business rules.
7. Update imports, dependencies, or configuration if required by the changes.
8. If requirements are ambiguous or conflicting, pause and ask for clarification instead of guessing.
